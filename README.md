**Laptop Rental Management System Documentation**

**1. Problem Statement**<br>
In many universities, students from remote areas face challenges in completing academic projects and assignments due to the unavailability of laptops. Purchasing a laptop is often not feasible for these students due to financial constraints. This lack of access limits their ability to work on Final Year Projects (FYPs), university assignments, and freelance opportunities, which can impact their academic and professional growth.

**2. Proposed Solution**<br>
To address this problem, we propose a Laptop Rental Management System that allows students to rent laptops for a specified duration. This system will facilitate students to complete their academic tasks without the burden of purchasing a laptop. The system will also ensure proper management of laptops, transactions, and student records through an efficient and user-friendly interface.

**3. Project Overview**<br>
The Laptop Rental Management System will be developed in the C programming language. The project will follow a modular structure, dividing the workload into four distinct modules to be assigned to a team of four members. The system will include features such as student registration, laptop inventory management, rental transactions, search functionality, and user authentication.

**Features:**<br>
Student Registration: Register students with their details.<br>
Laptop Inventory Management: Maintain a record of available laptops.<br>
Rental Transactions: Manage the rental process, including booking and returns.<br>
Authentication: Ensure secure access for admins and students.<br>
Search Functionality: Allow users to search for laptops and student records<br>
